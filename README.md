Back in 2008-ish Logitech released their G15 keyboard.
These keyboards had a little screen that allowed us to display various pieces of information on them. I loved the screen, and hated the keyboard.
I threw the thing away and started to lose a lot of time by checking my email all the time etc etc.

Using mostly mechanical keyboards I can not honestly say I expect to get a system that does what I want anytime soon. True to the affordable Raspberry Pi and it's screen I am now developing an applicance that can send specific information through USB to this screen in order to get my screenback.

Goals:
    - Write a Linux Driver to convert the USB - GPIO commands to program the appliance
    - Create an easy 'conky-like' API
    - Able to receive Chromecast streams, for easy multi tasking
    - Create an Tumbleweed based appliance that has very little setup, all done with a simple (windows) application over USB.
    - Learn more about the Linux Kernel
    - Have phun



Why is this called Ninox?
Ninox, is an awesome owl-kind, 'nuff said.
